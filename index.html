            <h4 class="item-header">MacBook Pro 2015</h4>
            <p>The 2015 MacBook Pro is arguably Apple's best MacBook Pro. This Mac
               has many features that new Macbooks either downgradded or eliminated altogether.</p>
            <h4 class="item-header">LG V20</h4>
            <p>The LG V20 is a flagship LG phone that was first produced in 2016. 
              I picked this phone up because it includes a powerful DAC and audio
               amplifier, a removable battery, and impressive technical specs.

            <h4 class="item-header">TimBuk 2 Messenger Bag</h4>
            <p>This is my messenger bag. I've had it for a while now. It fits everything I need
              with plenty of room to spare. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a
              modern, high-quality bag.

            <h4 class="item-header">KZ Earbuds</h4>
            <p>I purchased these earbuds from Amazon for about $15, and for the price 
              they have excellent sound quality. These make great "beater" earbuds.</p>
            <h4 class="item-header">Pilot G2 Pens</h4>
            <p>For the price I don't think that you can get better pens. The writing 
              performance is always smooth and consistent. You can find these in an 
              assortment of colors.
            </p>
            <h4 class="item-header">A Small Notebook</h4>
            <p>Lastly, I always carry a small notebook with me for when inspiration strikes.
